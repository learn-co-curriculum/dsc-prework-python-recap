# Data Science Prework - Python - Recap

## Introduction

In this section, you learned the fundamentals of Python! As you continue your Data Science journey, programming will continue to be one of the most important components of your toolkit.

## Key Takeaways

* **Data Types** - Data types are an essential part of programming. They allow computers to differentiate between different types of information and provide useful methods for manipulating data according to its type. 

* **Variables** - Variables allow us to label data so that programmers can easily identify what the data represents. Variables also alow us to store data into memory and use that saved data in future lines of code. 

* **Collections** - With collections, we are able to organize our data into structures for efficient manipulation and extraction. With lists we can store multiple data points within a single, index ordered, variable, and with dictionaries we are able to organize our data into different labeled categories. 

* **Visualization** - `matplotlib` allows us to better understand our data by creating bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.

* **Functions and Methods** - Python has a range of functions and methods (methods are functions associated with an object) that can help us to perform a wide range of useful tasks quickly and efficiently.
* **Loops** - Loops aren't only for collections. `while` loops allow us to iterate until a condition is met, and we can use nested loops for more complicated situations (but should be careful about doing so too often).
* **Custom Functions** - When you write a piece of code that you might want to use again, it often makes sense to save it in as a function, and you can add arguments to functions to allow them to be more flexible in the ways they're reused.
